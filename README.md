1)Data aquisition 

The functional connectivities based on cc200 atlas was aquired with your help together.
I have used the same configuration coding for cc400, and it was sucessful. However, for ho atlas, although it has runned sucesfully, no file was saved corresponding to ho.I can try it out again, and show it to you.

2) Modification

Following to "Data aquisition" step, the modification of this code is based on 200 and 329 ROIs that has affected number of layers, their shapes and so on.
